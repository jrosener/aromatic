{"name":"Aromatic","tagline":"A forecast parser for Meteo France AROME files","body":"# Aromatic\r\nA forecast parser for Meteo France AROME files.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n* Download the latest run of AROME 0.01 meteo files.\r\n* Parse them and extract wind speed/direction and temperature at a specific location.\r\n* 42 hours forecast for several locations exported as html file or txt format.\r\n\r\n# Known issues\r\n* Sometimes Meteo France servers are not providing AROME files properly: the name of the retrieved file is wrong (and the content as well). For the moment the only solution is to run again `aromatic` and hope that it will get the file ;-)\r\n* The whole software was written in a couple of hours without quality in mind. As a consequence, there are no tests and most of the returned errors are not checked. It obviously needs to be improved.\r\n\r\n# Runtime dependencies\r\n2 command line tools are required:\r\n* `curl`: needed to download AROME files from Meteo France servers.\r\n* `grib_get`: needed to parse AROME files and extract meteo data at a specific location (this tool is part of the GRIB API distribution: https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home).\r\n\r\n# Build requirements\r\n* `g++ 5.x`\r\n* `Qt 5.x` (`qmake` and `QtConcurrent` are necessary)\r\n\r\n# Build instructions\r\n* Install build dependencies (ex. for Ubuntu 15.10): `sudo apt-get install build-essential qt5-default libgrib-api-tools`\r\n* Generate makefile: `qmake aromatic.pro`\r\n* Build: `make`\r\n* Run (the forecast is generated for locations defined in `main.cpp`, so this is the place to add your favorite spots): `./aromatic`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
